/*
 * What is pointer to array of character in c?
 */

/*
Explanation:
A pointer to such an array which contents is character constants is known as pointer to array of character constant.
What will be output if you will execute following code?
*/
#include<stdio.h>
char display(char (*)[]);
int main()
{
	char c;
	char character[]={65,66,67,68};
	char (*ptr)[]=&character;
	c=display(ptr);
	printf("%c",c);
	return 0;
}
char display(char (*s)[])
{
	**s+=2;
	return **s;
}

/*
Output: C
Explanation: Here function display is passing pointer to array of characters and returning char data type.
**s+=2
=>**s=**s+2
=>**ptr=**ptr+2 //s=ptr
=>**&character= **&character+2 //ptr=&character
=>*character=*character+2 //from rule *&p =p
=>character[0]=character[0]+2 //from rule *(p+i)=p[i]
=>character [0] =67
**s=character [0] =67
Note: ASCII value of ‘C’ is 67
