objective: 
[1] pre-assessment to the needed prerequisites before starting!!

to-do-list:
1. convert the videos, pictures, and musics to more compressed forms
2. delete the unneeded files
3. compress the uncommon used files to zip or much more compressed forms
4. shrink the partation 
5. bring all the needed data to the same place, which is the partaion
6. use qemu to create the image of the shrinked partaion
