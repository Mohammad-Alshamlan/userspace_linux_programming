/*
 * Write a server. This server is very similar to the echo server running on port 7. 
 * Basically, the echo server receives text from the client and then sends that exact text back to the client. This is just about 
 * the simplest server you can write. Note that this server handles only one client. Try to modify it to handle multiple clients 
 * using  threads.
